- Worked with **dynamic arrays, linked lists, and complex data structures**.

### ðŸ”¹ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Implemented **classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction**.
- Explored **operator overloading** and advanced **class hierarchy design**.

### ðŸ”¹ Templates & Generic Programming
- Created **templated classes and functions** for reusable and efficient coding.
- Applied **generic programming** principles in various data structures.

### ðŸ”¹ Exception Handling & Error Management
- Implemented structured **exception handling (`try`, `catch`, `throw`)**.
- Designed **fault-tolerant applications** with custom error handling.

### ðŸ”¹ Multi-Threading & Concurrency
- Explored **multi-threaded programming** concepts using **C++ threads**.
- Managed **synchronization issues** with **mutex locks and condition variables**.

### ðŸ”¹ Data Representation & Bitwise Operations
- Worked with **bitwise manipulation** for optimizing performance.
- Learned about **low-level data representation and efficient bit operations**.

### ðŸ”¹ GUI Programming & Visual C++ Development
- Gained exposure to **visual programming** and **graphical user interfaces (GUI)**.
- Developed **event-driven applications** using C++.
